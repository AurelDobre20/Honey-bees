# Honey-bees

Honeybee icon by Icons8

Interactive honey-bees game which consists of three games:
The first one is an animation made using Canvas which starts when the Start button is pressed.
The second one is a game which looks like Minesweeper in which you have to "steal" the honey from the
honeycomb without getting caught by the bees. It has 3 levels of difficulty. Here, I used Canvas again for
drawing the table/honeycomb.
The last game is a map where the user can click on a country from the EU and find out how many
beehives are in that country. For creating the map, I used the Leaflet API.
